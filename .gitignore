#This is my gitignore file. It doesn't really apply to this project but
#I learned about the sorts of filetypes I might want to ignore, like
# automatically generated files like .logs and packages and compied files.
#In the case of packages etc it's better to unpack and commit separately.
#I also learned I could create a global .gitignore file to specify 
#filetypes that should be excluded from all repositories.
